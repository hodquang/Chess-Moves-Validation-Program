###### HOW TO RUN MY PROGRAM ######
1. Run ChessMain.py in order to get the legal moves of a targeted piece.
	The function getValidMove() takes in the current board config, the target piece and its color to output our piece's legal moves

2. Install pytest then run test_Chess.py in order to see that all the test cases have been passed. You can view in details the different board configurations for each tests.

######## TESTING ##########
I used the pytest library with the command "pip install pytest" then "pytest", or "pytest test_Chess.py" to run my test cases. The test cases in test_Chess.py are very straight forward. I used about 4-5 different chess board configurations to test many different scenarios and pieces movement. I checked in details the functions that are related to confirming checks, confirming valid moves, and drawing/confirming the valid boards/pieces.
